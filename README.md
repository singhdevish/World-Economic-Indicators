# World-Economic-Indicators

## About World-Economic-Indicators
Economic indicators include measures of macroeconomic performance (gross domestic product [GDP], consumption, investment, and international trade) and stability (central government budgets, prices, the money supply, and the balance of payments).

## About Project
### Project Name: World-Economic-Indicators

### Problem Statement:
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a department under its name which will focus on how a country can attain sustainable growth. This organisation want to determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/ Capita. We have the dataset (World Economic Indicator Dataset), which has different countries and regions' GDP, population, and other factors that might impact GDP/Capita. By using Data Analysis methods, developed a solution that can be referred to as "how a country can attain sustainable growth".

### Steps to Followed:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered the World Economic Indicator Dataset containing GDP, population, and other factors for different countries and regions.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Checked for missing values and outliers.
   - Standardized column names and formats for consistency.
   - Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Rearranged the columns in all sheets to bring common columns as the first three columns.
   - Formatted each sheet for better presentation and understanding.
   - Applied data processing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis.

4. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Examined the distribution of individual features (e.g., GDP, population, health expenditure per capita) using histograms, box plots, and summary statistics.
   - Identified any patterns or outliers in the data that may require further investigation.

5. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Explored the relationship between pairs of variables (e.g., GDP vs. health expenditure per capita, GDP vs. lending interest rates) using scatter plots, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
   - Determined the strength and direction of the relationships to understand how different factors impact GDP per capita.

6. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features that could potentially improve the model's performance or provide additional insights (e.g., calculating energy consumption per capita from existing data).

7. **Data Analysis:**
   - Conducted a detailed analysis of how each factor (e.g., tourism outbound per capita, energy consumption per capita) impacts GDP per capita.
   - Developed a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing sustainable economic growth.

8. **Storytelling:**
   - Presented key findings and insights in a clear and compelling manner.
   - Highlighted the most impactful factors and proposed actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarized the main findings and their implications for achieving sustainable economic growth.
   - Emphasized the importance of investing in healthcare, promoting sustainable energy consumption, and other key strategies for economic development.
